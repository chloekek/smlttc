Tulisp is a programming language.
It exposes system calls with minimal change in name and behavior.
It is not necessary to compile Tulisp code prior to running it;
the interpreter will take care of that automatically.


cargo

    A wrapper around Cargo, to set the target path and the working directory.
    Run it with “nix run” from the repository root.

        nix run -ic tulisp/cargo build
