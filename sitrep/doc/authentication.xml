    <para>
        Every remote procedure call and stream of log messages
        is accompanied by an identity and a token.
        A token is a sequence of 128 bits that allows the server
        to verify the identity of the client.
        Tokens can be created either by logging in with a password,
        or by creating one explicitly via the API.
        Each token has an expiry date.
        After the expiry date, the token can no longer be used.
