    <para>
        An access control list, or ACL for short,
        is a database table that configures authorization.
        An ACL pairs identities with foreign keys to other objects,
        and RLS policies check that suitable such pairs exist in the ACL.

    <note>
        <para>
            Not all authorization checks use ACLs.
            ACLs are used only for associating identities to other objects,
            such as journals.
            Authorization checks that do not need ACLs
            are implemented differently.
