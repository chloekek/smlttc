Sitrep is a program that stores log messages and extracts metrics from them.


build.pl

    The build script. Run it with “nix run” from the repository root.

        nix run -ic sitrep/build.pl


sitrep-receive

    Retrieves log messages on stdin and saves them to the database.
    It does not listen on a TCP address, but serves a single connection.
    It is meant to run under socat(1) or similar software for listening.


    Authentication

        To authenticate with the receiver, an identity and a key are necessary.
        The identity is not a secret and the key is a secret.
        The identity is looked up in the database in logarithmic time.
        If that succeeds, the key is compared in constant time.
        If that succeeds, authentication is complete.
        Then, log messages may be sent.


database

    The database schema, as a series of Sqitch migrations.
